# dsfb-swarm

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/infinityabundance/dsfb/blob/main/crates/dsfb-swarm/notebooks/dsfb_swarm_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/infinityabundance/dsfb/blob/main/crates/dsfb-swarm/notebooks/dsfb_swarm_colab.ipynb)

`dsfb-swarm` is a standalone Rust crate that turns the paper *Deterministic Spectral Residual Inference for Swarm Interaction Networks: A DSFB Framework for Structural Phase Stability* into a reproducible empirical workflow. It simulates time-varying swarm interaction graphs, computes Laplacian spectra, predicts `lambda_k(t)` deterministically, measures residuals and residual derivatives, applies trust-gated interaction attenuation, compares against baselines, and writes a timestamped artifact bundle with figures, CSVs, JSON, Markdown, and PDF output.

## Why this crate exists

The paper is about more than plotting `lambda_2(t)`. Its main point is that deterministic spectral prediction plus residual-centered diagnosis can reveal structural phase changes in a swarm interaction network before visible fragmentation is obvious. This crate exists to make those claims inspectable:

- it constructs a dynamic graph `G(t)` from interacting agents,
- it builds the Laplacian `L(t) = D(t) - A(t)`,
- it monitors `lambda_2(t)` and higher modes,
- it predicts those modes with deterministic predictors `hat lambda_k(t)`,
- it forms residuals `r_k(t) = lambda_k(t) - hat lambda_k(t)`,
- it computes residual drift, residual slew, and residual envelopes,
- it adds mode-shape residuals with eigenvector sign-ambiguity handling,
- it attenuates interactions through trust-gated edge weights,
- it compares the residual loop against simpler baselines,
- it exports enough raw and summarized data for paper-style interpretation.

The crate is intentionally self-contained. It includes its own `Cargo.toml`, local notebook, tests, and crate-local default output root so it can be run from `crates/dsfb-swarm` without requiring workspace edits elsewhere.

## What mathematical ideas it demonstrates

The implementation follows the paper’s intended objects and terminology:

- Dynamic swarm interaction graph `G(t)` with weighted adjacency `A(t)`.
- Degree matrix `D(t)` and Laplacian `L(t) = D(t) - A(t)`.
- Laplacian eigenvalues `lambda_k(t)`, especially algebraic connectivity `lambda_2(t)`.
- Deterministic spectral predictors:
  - zero-order hold,
  - first-order extrapolation,
  - smooth corrective extrapolation.
- Spectral residuals `r_{lambda_k}(t) = lambda_k(t) - hat lambda_k(t)`.
- Residual drift and residual slew as first and second finite-difference diagnostics.
- Residual envelopes and anomaly certificates.
- Finite-time detectability interpretation through persistent negative residual drift.
- Practical boundedness of the predictor-residual loop in nominal settings.
- Correlation between residual magnitude and Laplacian perturbation scale `||Delta L||_F`.
- Multi-mode residual stack `r_Lambda(t)` for `lambda_2 .. lambda_{m+1}`.
- Optional mode-shape residuals from eigenvector comparison with sign ambiguity handling.
- Trust-gated effective interaction weights `a_ij(t) = T_ij(t) * tilde a_ij(t)`.

The code does not claim a formal proof. It produces deterministic empirical evidence aligned with the paper’s framework.

## Scenario design

The crate runs four paper-facing scenarios:

1. `nominal`
   - Stable connected coordination.
   - Bounded deterministic excitation.
   - No persistent structural degradation.

2. `gradual_edge_degradation`
   - Bridge edges weaken progressively.
   - `lambda_2(t)` contracts over time.
   - Residual drift should become persistently negative before visible failure.

3. `adversarial_agent`
   - One agent injects inconsistent state and motion.
   - The disturbance is localized before trust gating attenuates its influence.
   - Multi-mode and mode-shape diagnostics are most useful here.

4. `communication_loss`
   - Cross-cluster bridge links collapse.
   - The graph fragments and `lambda_2(t)` falls sharply.
   - Trust and residual alarms should respond before or near fragmentation.

## CLI usage

Run all scenarios with default settings:

cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- run
```

Run a single scenario:

```bash
cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- run --scenario nominal
```

Run a paper-facing multi-mode diagnostic:

```bash
cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- run --scenario adversarial-agent --multi-mode --modes 4 --mode-shapes
```

Run the benchmark suite across all scenarios:

```bash
cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- benchmark --all-scenarios
```

Run a custom scaling and noise sweep:

```bash
cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- benchmark \
  --all-scenarios \
  --sizes 20,50,100,200,500 \
  --noise 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2 \

```

Quickstart example:

```bash
cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- quickstart
```

Regenerate a compact report for the newest run:

```bash
cd crates/dsfb-swarm
cargo run --release -- report
```

### Optional config file

The CLI accepts JSON or TOML config patches through `--config`.

Example TOML:

```toml
[run]
scenario = "communication-loss"
steps = 240
agents = 48
multi_mode = true
monitored_modes = 5
mode_shapes = true
noise_level = 0.05
```

## Output directory structure

To avoid collateral writes elsewhere in the repository, the default output root is crate-local:

```text
crates/dsfb-swarm/output-dsfb-swarm/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/
```

Each run creates a fresh timestamped directory. No prior output is overwritten.

Core artifacts:

- `manifest.json`
- `run_config.json`
- `scenarios_summary.csv`
- `benchmark_summary.csv`
- `time_series.csv`
- `spectra.csv`
- `residuals.csv`
- `trust.csv`
- `baselines.csv`
- `anomalies.json`
- `scenario_<name>_metrics.csv`
- `scenario_<name>_timeseries.csv`
- `figures/*.png`
- `report/dsfb_swarm_report.md`
- `report/dsfb_swarm_report.pdf`

## What the figures and tables are meant to show

- `lambda2_timeseries.png`
  - Visible contraction or collapse of algebraic connectivity.

- `residual_timeseries.png`
  - Predictor versus observation and the residual envelope.

- `drift_slew.png`
  - Residual derivative diagnostics for finite-time detectability.

- `trust_evolution.png`
  - Trust suppression of degraded or adversarial influence.

- `baseline_comparison.png`
  - Detection lead-time comparison versus non-predictive baselines.

- `scaling_curves.png`
  - Runtime growth with swarm size.

- `noise_stress_curves.png`
  - TPR/FPR behavior under bounded deterministic noise stress.

- `multimode_comparison.png`
  - Benefit of stacked multi-eigenvalue monitoring over `lambda_2` only.

- `topology_snapshots.png`
  - Concrete graph changes corresponding to spectral warnings.

## Reproducibility notes

- The swarm dynamics are deterministic except for bounded analytic pseudo-noise terms generated from fixed trigonometric expressions.
- Identical settings reproduce the same metrics and figures except for the timestamped folder name.
- The output root is local to this crate by default, which keeps the crate self-contained.
- The notebook rebuilds the crate and reruns the benchmark suite from scratch every time.

## Colab notebook

The notebook at `notebooks/dsfb_swarm_colab.ipynb` is designed to:

- bootstrap Rust in Colab if needed,
- locate or clone the repository,
- build `dsfb-swarm` from source,
- run the benchmark suite from scratch,
- locate the newest timestamped output directory,
- load CSV/JSON artifacts,
- display figures and tables inline,
- assemble a PDF report,
- create a zip archive containing the full artifact bundle.

The Colab badge uses a placeholder repository URL. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REPO` with the actual repository path when publishing the notebook.

## Limitations

- The simulator is intentionally stylized rather than domain-specific.
- Trust is driven by deterministic residual and disagreement logic, not by a learned model.
- The PDF written by the Rust crate is a compact summary report; the notebook can regenerate a richer PDF bundle using the figure outputs.
- The benchmark suite is designed for demonstrative reproducibility, not for maximum numerical efficiency.

## Future extensions

- richer swarm kinematics and heading dynamics,
- explicit predictor correction loops per mode,
- stronger mode-shape alignment under clustered eigenvalues,
- more detailed graph-theoretic certificates,
- alternative trust policies and adversary models,
- tighter report/PDF integration with embedded figures.
